# PFA_ML_Sandbox_CMS
To be merged with the NV PFA repository - scripts from the DOE funded NV machine learning project.


This is meant to be an interactive tool for users to explore unsupervised clustering applied to the Nevada ML PFA data set and produce outputs of cluster maps and feature variance scores. This script introduces principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization and allows the user to isolate training data or incorporate the full feature data set.
